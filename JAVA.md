## Java

### VEngine
[Source](https://github.com/dhog10/VEngine)

VEngine is a Java project I worked on during my time studying Computing in college. I developed this to improve my ability to program in Java aswel as improving my understanding of basic object management principals for game engines. VEngine is a basic game engine for Java which includes rendering for sprites and gifs, 2D physics rigidbody simulation and collisons between circles and axis aligned rectangles. I gained a better understanding of rigidbody collision response techniques in particular whilst programming this.

This project greatly improved my knowledge in Java, making use of various techniques such as multi threading, lambda and user input. This not only improved my ability with Java, but also improved my general understanding of such concepts, and OOP in general.

I also developed a better understanding of certain game related systems, such as object management, threading, render and tick loops, delta time and rigidbody behaviour.
